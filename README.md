5v & 3.3v Dual Voltage Regulator
================================
This board accepts a reasonable input (20v or less) and provides both 5v and 3.3v regulated outputs.

Parts
-----
Here's the parts I use when building this myself:

**10uF Capacitors**: [DigiKey Part P975-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en/capacitors/aluminum-capacitors/131081?k=P975-ND)

**0.1uF Capacitors**: [DigiKey Part 399-4266-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/C320C104M5U5TA/399-4266-ND/818042)

**5v Linear Regulator**: [DigiKey Part MC7805CT-BPMS-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/MC7805CT-BP/MC7805CT-BPMS-ND/804682)

**3.3v Linear Regulator**: [DigiKey Part 296-21633-5-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/UA78M33CKCS/296-21633-5-ND/1494026)

With these regulators you can run about 1A through the 5v output and 0.5A through the 3.3v output.
If you go that high you should seriously think about adding 
[heat sinks](http://www.digikey.com/product-search/en/fans-thermal-management/thermal-heat-sinks/1179752) 
to the regulators.
